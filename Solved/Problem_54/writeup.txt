My code is anything but elegant for this.
My general approach was to store the value of the hand in an array.
The first element would contain the rank of the hand, ie 0 = high card, 1 = pair, 2 = two pair, ... , 8 = royal flush.
Then, the rest of the numbers would be the numbers that broke ties.
For example, in two full houses, whoever had the higher triplet would win, so I stored the array as [6, (number of triplet), (number of pair)]
Then, I checked every index of the arrays until one had a higher number, which would be the better hand.

Answer: 376
