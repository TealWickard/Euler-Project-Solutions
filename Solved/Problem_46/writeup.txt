I decided to implement a more efficient prime testing method, as I would need to check every odd number regardless.
For every composite odd number C, I then checked if for every i such that 2 * i * i < C, if C - 2 * i * i is prime.
The first C for which no such i exists such that C - 2 * i * i is prime is the answer.

Runtime: O(N^(3/2)) I think...
