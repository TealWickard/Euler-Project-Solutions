While likely overkill, instead of calculating if each individual number was a triangle number, I put the first 100 triangle numbers in a hashmap.
This way I could know in O(1) if any number was a triangle number, since no word would exceed the 100th number.
I then iterated through every word, summing (c - 64) because each char was uppercase.

Runtime: O(N*length(N)) N = word number, length(N) = word length
