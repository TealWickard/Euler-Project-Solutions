First, I wrote a function to calculate the total distinct prime factors.
This function will double as a prime checker, as if there are 0 distinct prime factors less than N, N is prime.
I then checked every number to see how many distinct prime factors it had, adding it to the arraylist of primes if it was prime.
When 4 primes in a row have exactly 4 distinct prime factors, I broke out of the loop, and returned the first one.

Runtime: O(N^2) I think? It's getting really hard to calculate accurate runtimes.
Answer: 134043

Notes:
The runtime was quite slow, taking about 5 seconds to produce an answer.
I suspect my inefficiency comes from my distinctPrimes function.
I was able to speed up my code to about 1 second by identifying primes faster, breaking if there are more than 4 distinct primes, and looking through fewer numbers.
