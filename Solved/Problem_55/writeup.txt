Working with large large numbers, gotta use BigInteger.
There are two main functions at play here: reversing a BigInteger and checking if it is a palindrome.
For reversing it, I opted to use StringBuilder, as I believe it should run quicker than making the string normally.
To check if it's a palindrome, I iterated over the first half of its digits and checked if the mirror digit is the same.
