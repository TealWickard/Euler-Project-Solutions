I cannot think of a way to rigorously prove this.
Instead, I guessed that the answer would be the difference between two of the first 10000 pentagonal numbers.
To save runtime, I stored the first 10000 pentagonal numbers in a hashmap so I could access them in O(1).
I then iterated through all i, j < 10000 such that i <= j, and printed the smallest difference.
This turned out to give the correct solution, but I do not know how to prove that the answer must exist in the first 10000 pentagonal numbers.

Runtime: O(N^2?) where N is the number of pentagonal numbers I checked.
