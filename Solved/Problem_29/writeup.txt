I first solved this problem with math, and I will show my approach below:
What causes a^b to equal c^d?
This only occurs if one is a power of the other.
WLOG, assume a < c.
Let a^k = c.
(a^k)^d = a^kd = a^b, so kd = b.
For any given a, there are only so many k that make it so c is still under 101.
Furthermore, both d and b have to be under 101.

Let a = 2.
k = 2, c = 4.
For any even b, b/2 = d makes a^b = c^d. 50 total overcounts
k = 3, c = 8.
For any b s.t 3|b, b/3 = d makes a^b = c^d. 33 total overcounts - 16 already overcounted (6 | b) = 17 overcounts
k = 4, c = 16...
This continues for all a < 11

Now let's try with BigInteger.
I used collections.sort, and then checked if the next item was the same as the current one, and only increment answer when they differed.
