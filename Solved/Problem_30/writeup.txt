Figuring out if any number's sum of digits to the 5th power is equal to itself is a simple calculation.
The other half of this question is knowing when to stop.
If the number was 6 9s, 999999, the sum of the digits to the fifth power is 354294, which is under 999999.
Therefore, 354294 is an upper limit.
This upper limit can be reduced further, but since the algorithm's runtime is quick, I found this sufficient.

Runtime: O(Nlog10(N))
