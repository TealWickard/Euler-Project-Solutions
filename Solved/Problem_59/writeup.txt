Likely the "best" way of doing this problem is to match decrypted text using various keys to a dictionary, and see which key has the most words.
Instead, given that the key was 3 lowercase letters, I instead found each letter that produced the most decrypted letters.
With this key, I then summed up the original message using bitwise XOR.

Answer: 129448

Notes:
My method does not guarantee a solution, as if every third character happened to be a number or symbol, the code might return a wrong character.
Hence why an exhaustion approach against a dictionary would be more effective.
