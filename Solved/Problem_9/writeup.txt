WLOG, let a >= b
This means that c > a >= b, because if a or b > c, a^2 + b^2 =/= c^2.
This allows me to remove numerous cases, but I still iterate over a and b.

Runtime: O(N^2)
Answer: 31875000

Notes:
I have a feeling this can be done in O(N) with clever math. I may have to return to this at some point.
