This problem is divided into 3 sections: finding 4 digit primes, finding 3 that are consecutive, and finding if they share the same digits.
For finding 4 digit primes, I reused the isPrime function I wrote in a previous problem and iterated through all odd 4 digit numbers.
To find if they are consecutive, I iterated through every 4 digit prime i, and then checked for all larger 4 digit primes j, if j + (j - i) was a 4 digit prime.
If it is, I then ran compDigits, to compare digits.
I decided to do a bucket sort of sorts to count digits, as it would run in O(1).
Finally, I checked to make sure the first number wasn't 1487, because that was the example given in the problem.

Runtime: O(N ^ (3/2))
