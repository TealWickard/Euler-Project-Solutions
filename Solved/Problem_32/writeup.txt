There's a bit of math I can do to simplify things, starting with analysis of last digit multiplication.

X0 * YZ = Q0, which uses 0 twice.
0 cannot be the last digit of either the multicand or multiplier.
X1 * YZ = QZ, which uses Z twice.
1 cannot be the last digit of either the multicand or multiplier.
There are other products that don't work, like X6 * Y8 = Z8.
The valid products are:
X2 * Y3 = Z6
X2 * Y4 = Z8
X2 * Y7 = Z4
X2 * Y8 = Z6
X2 * Y9 = Z8
X3 * Y4 = Z2
X3 * Y6 = Z8
X3 * Y7 = Z1
X3 * Y8 = Z4
X3 * Y9 = Z7
X4 * Y7 = Z8
X4 * Y8 = Z2
X4 * Y9 = Z6
X6 * Y7 = Z2
X6 * Y9 = Z4
X7 * Y8 = Z6
X7 * Y9 = Z3
X8 * Y9 = Z2

While this may look like a lot, it is only 18 out of a possible 100.

Next, let's look at digit analysis.
The valid number of digits are:
1 * 4 = 4
4 * 1 = 4
2 * 3 = 4
3 * 2 = 4

With all this analysis, I think the number of cases I need check are low enough to brute force.
I added the hits to an arraylist to prevent duplication.

Runtime: O(N^2) where N is something? It's hard to give an exact number
