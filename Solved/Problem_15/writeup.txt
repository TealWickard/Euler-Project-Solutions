While I initially tried to do this recursively, this is a simple combinatoric problem.
Let the path of turns be a string of R and Ds, ie "RRRDDDRDRRRDRDRRD...".
Let the initial path be a string of 20 rights turns, ie "RRRRRRR...".
There are 21 different locations in that string to insert the first D.
The second D has 22, the third D has 23, etc until 41.
However, there is overcounting because the D can be place in any order.
To counteract this, I had to divide by 20!, because that is the amount of permutations of 20 unique objects.

Runtime: O(N)
