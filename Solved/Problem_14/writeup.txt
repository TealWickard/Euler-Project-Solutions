For this problem, I didn't want to have to redo sequences of numbers I had already been to in order to conserve runtime.
To counteract this, every time I finished a sequence, I stored its length in a hashmap.
This way, whenever a element in the sequence is less than its starting value, the rest of the sequence's length will be stored in the hashmap.
All that's left is implementing the Collatz sequence and iterating through the first million numbers.

Runtime: Unsure what the runtime of any Collatz sequence is.
