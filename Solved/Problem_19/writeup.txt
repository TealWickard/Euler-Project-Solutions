I'm not sure if Java's built-in Date class works consistently a century ago, so I decided to implement the rules given.
I stored each piece of data seperately, and then incremented the day and checked to see if the next week/month/year would roll over.
I then checked every date until 2001 to see if it was a Sunday on the first day.

Runtime: O(N)
Answer: 171

Notes:
I can probably save some runtime by skipping months.
I only care about checking the first of each month, so when I enter January for example, I could increment day by 31 and dayOfWeek by 31 % 7.
