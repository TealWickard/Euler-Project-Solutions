I can simplify things by using some things I know about combinatorics.
First, C(X, Y) = C(X, X - Y).
Next, C(X, Y + 1) > C(X, Y) if Y < X / 2.
What this tells us, is that for the smallest value r such that C(n, r) > 1000000, all values between r and n - r (inclusive) will be greater than 1000000.
So when I find the smallest value r, I can add n - 2r + 1 values and increment n.
Additionally, the problem says I can start at n = 23, so I will!
