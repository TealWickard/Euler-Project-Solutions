There are only 10 different factorials that need taking in this question, so to save time, I made a function that runs in O(1) to speed up the calculations.
The first half of this problem is calculating the sum of factorials, which wasn't too complicated.
The second half is establishing an upperbound. 9! = 362880, so if a 7 digit number was all 9s, it would be 3265920, which is less than 9999999.
After using that as my upper bound, I got the solution.

Runtime: O(N)
Answer: 40730

Notes:
The program is a bit slow, taking about a second to get an answer.
My upper bound is about 100x the answer, so I could reduce the amount of times the loop runs.
