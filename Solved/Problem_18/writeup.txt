The problem implied it wanted you to brute force (O(2^N)) this and later do a cleaner solution later, but I figured I'd do the clean solution first.
If the triangle is only two units high, the path is trivial, just go left if left is higher, otherwise right.
We can apply this philosophy to the penultimate row of the triangle.
At each of the 14 numbers, if the path is currently there, we know the next step is whichever is higher.
Because of this, we can replace these 14 numbers with their value added to the highest value they can reach.
this process continues to work recursively on the penultimate row until there is only one item in the triangle, which is the answer.

Runtime: O(N^2)
