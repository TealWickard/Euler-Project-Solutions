For this problem, I decided to use BigIntegers, as the numbers started out too large for integers, and I wanted to keep them as integers.
While I only needed to check prime divisors, checking if the divisors were prime would likely take longer than just checking every number.
Whenever I found a factor, I divided it out of the initial number.
I only have to go up to sqrt(starting number), because anything larger than that cannot be a factor.

Runtime: O(sqrt(N))
