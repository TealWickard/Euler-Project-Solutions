This problem becomes a lot simpler when you realize the basic recursive formula the numerator and denominator are using.
let num(n) and den(n) represent the numerator and denominator of the fraction at the nth iteration.
num(n + 1) = num(n) + 2 * den(n)
den(n + 1) = num(n) + den(n)
From this, I can easily calculate the numerators and denominators.
Since the recursive formula is multiplicative, there will be hundreds of digits, so I am using BigInteger and toString.length() to compare.

Answer: 153
