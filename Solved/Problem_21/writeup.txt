For this problem, I started by calculating the divisors of each number from 2 to 10000.
I then iterated through each number and checked if it was amicable.

Runtime: O(N*sqrt(N))
Answer: 31626

Notes:
I'm curious if there's a more efficient solution.
In hindsight, a HashMap is probably the best data type to use here.
An array would likely work just as well while using much less memory.
