At first I thought I was going to have to look to prime up to 10^9, which is a bit daunting.
Fortunately, using divisbility rules, this can be simplified greatly.
If the sum of the digits in a number is divisible by 3, so is the number.
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45, 3|45
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36, 3|36
Since pandigital numbers will always have these numbers, any 8 or 9-digit pandigital number will be divisible by 3.
Same holds for 2, 3, 5, and 6 digit numbers.
This means I only need to look at 4 and 7 digit pandigital numbers.
There's only 5040 7 digit pandigital numbers, and the number has to end in 1, 3, or 7 so only 2160 of them can be prime.

I added exactly the 2160 possible pandigital primes by recursively iterating through a linkedlist.
I then sorted it and started from the highest value.
The first prime I find would have to be the highest prime.

Runtime: O(D!), where D is maximum digits.
