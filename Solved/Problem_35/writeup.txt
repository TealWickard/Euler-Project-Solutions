Any number above 5 that ends in a even number or 5 will be composite.
This drastically narrows down the quantity of numbers to try, as every digit will have to be 1, 3, 7, or 9.
This alone should reduce the runtime to an acceptable time.
To facilitate rotating the number, I stored it as a string, and only turned it back to an int when I need to check if it was prime.
The second half of the code is ensuring no even or 5 digits.

Runtime: O(N)
Answer: 55
