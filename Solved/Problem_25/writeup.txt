This is another problem that just relies on knowing how to use BigIntegers.

Runtime: O(N)
Answer: 4782

Notes:
I believe there is a way to do this mathematically, as fibonacci numbers have a closed form.
They also can be approximated with a exponential series, multiplying by phi.
Perhaps I will have to do this in a future problem where the number is too high to compute.
